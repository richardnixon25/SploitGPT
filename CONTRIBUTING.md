## Adding New Tools

To add a new security tool integration:

1. Create a new file in `sploitgpt/tools/`
2. Implement the tool following the existing patterns
3. Register it in `sploitgpt/tools/__init__.py`
4. Add tests in `tests/test_tools_*.py`
5. Update documentation if needed

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Mock external services (Ollama, Metasploit) in tests

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- OS and version
- Python version
- GPU info (if relevant)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs or error messages

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix
- Update tests and documentation
- Ensure CI passes
- Respond to review feedback promptly

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, contact the maintainers directly.
